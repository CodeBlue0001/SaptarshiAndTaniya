# ✅ StorageMonitor Import Error - FIXED!

## 🐛 **Original Problem**

```
ReferenceError: StorageMonitor is not defined
    at Upload (src/pages/Upload.tsx:666:51)
```

**Root Cause**: The `StorageMonitor` component was being used in the Upload.tsx component but the import statement was missing.

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

### **Missing Import Fixed**

Added the missing import statement to `src/pages/Upload.tsx`:

```typescript
// Before (missing import)
import React from "react";
import { Navigate, Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { FileUpload } from "@/components/ui/file-upload";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

// After (fixed with import)
import React from "react";
import { Navigate, Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { FileUpload } from "@/components/ui/file-upload";
import { StorageMonitor } from "@/components/gallery/StorageMonitor"; // ✅ Added this line
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
```

### **Usage Location**

The `StorageMonitor` component was being used on line 347 in Upload.tsx:

```typescript
<StorageMonitor onClearCache={loadData} />
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **Why This Happened**

1. **Component Created**: The `StorageMonitor` component was created in a previous fix
2. **Usage Added**: The component was added to the Upload.tsx JSX
3. **Import Missing**: The import statement was not added to the imports section
4. **Runtime Error**: React couldn't find the component definition
